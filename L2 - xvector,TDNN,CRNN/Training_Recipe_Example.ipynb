        "\n",
        "In the previous tutorial, we have seen the basic components of speechbrain.\n",
        "Now, we will clarify how to combine them with a real example\n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, we will implement a **classification** system with SpeechBrain. We will walk you through all the steps needed to implement an **utterance-level classifier** in SpeechBrain.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The tutorial will initially focus on **speaker identification** and will describe, along the way, how to extend it to many other classification tasks such as **language-id**, **emotion recognition**, **sound classification**, **keyword spotting**, and many others.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Models**\n",
        "Many neural models can be used to approach this kind of task. In this tutorial, we will focus on a **TDNN** classifier (*xvector*) and a very recent model called [**ECAPA-TDNN**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07143) that showed impressive performance in speaker verification and diarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Data**\n",
        "Training will be done with a small open-source dataset called [mini-librispeech](https://www.openslr.org/31/), which only contains a few hours of training data. In a real case, you need a much larger dataset.\n",
        "For some examples of a real task, please [take a look at our Voxceleb recipes](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/recipes/VoxCeleb/SpeakerRec).\n",
        "\n",

        "Training an utterance-level classifier is relatively easy in SpeechBrain. The steps to follows are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Prepare your data**.\n",
        "The goal of this step is to create the data manifest files (in CSV or JSON format). The data manifest files tell SpeechBrain where to find the speech data and their corresponding utterance-level classification (e.g., speaker id). In this tutorial, the data manifest files are created by [mini_librispeech_prepare.py](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/templates/speaker_id/mini_librispeech_prepare.py).  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Train the classifier**.\n",
        "At this point, we are ready to train our classifier.\n",
        "To train  a speaker-id classifier based on TDNN + statistical pooling (xvectors), run the following command:\n",
        "```\n",
        "cd speechbrain/templates/speaker_id/\n",
        "python train.py train.yaml\n",
        "```\n",
        "Later, we will describe how to plug another model called Emphasized Channel Attention, Propagation, and Aggregation model (ECAPA) that turned out to provide impressive performance in speaker recognition tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Use the classifier (inference)**:\n",
        "After training, we can use the classifier for inference. A class called `EncoderClassifier` is designed to make inference easier. We also designed a class called `SpeakerRecognition` to make inference on a speaker verification task easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

If the model is a more complex chain of computations, you can create it as an instance of `torch.nn.Module` and define there the `__init__` and `forward` methods like [here](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/speechbrain/lobes/models/Xvector.py#L18).\n",
